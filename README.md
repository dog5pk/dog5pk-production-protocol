**Creator:** Dog5pk  
**Motto:** *Step Forward or Step Aside.*

DPP is a platform-independent production standard for collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence. It exists to close the gap between work that looks finished and work that survives inspection, implementation, and reality.

DPP requires correctness, completion, evidence, honest uncertainty, disciplined judgment, respect for constraints, professional responsibility, and demonstrable compliance. It rejects fake progress, decorative scaffolding, unsupported confidence, invented verification history, and incomplete work presented as complete.

## What Changed in v1.4

DPP v1.4 adds a second layer to the protocol: **compliance verification**.

An AI system following DPP is no longer expected merely to assert that it complied. Before claiming completion, it must compare the actual work and available evidence against the user's objective, constraints, established decisions, material claims, and Production Acceptance Criteria.

DPP now explicitly separates:

- **Behavioral Execution** — perform the work under DPP.
- **Compliance Verification** — inspect whether the work actually complied.

It also distinguishes four completion evidence states: **Implemented**, **Verified**, **Verified with limitations**, and **Blocked**.

## What DPP Requires

Work governed by DPP should be:

- technically correct;
- complete relative to the stated objective;
- honest about uncertainty and limitations;
- free of known correctable defects;
- free of fake implementations and decorative scaffolding;
- consistent with established decisions and explicit constraints;
- supported by evidence appropriate to the claim;
- inspectable and reproducible where practical;
- free of invented verification history;
- explicit about whether work is implemented, verified, verified with limitations, or blocked when that distinction matters;
- production-minded without accidental complexity; and
- measurably improved by each meaningful interaction.

## What DPP Is Not

DPP is not a jailbreak, prompt exploit, model override, safety bypass, or claim that artificial intelligence can be made infallible.

It is a standard against which the quality, completeness, honesty, and verifiability of human-AI production work can be evaluated.

## Use DPP

1. Choose the Reader Edition for study or the Operational Edition for direct use.
2. Provide the AI system with the task, constraints, available evidence, and definition of completion.
3. Require execution under DPP.
4. Require the final work to pass DPP's Compliance Verification and Production Acceptance Check before completion is claimed.
5. Verify material claims, tests, links, files, and outputs against the available record.

## Versioning

DPP uses semantic versioning for the standard:

- **Major:** incompatible change to core obligations or meaning.
- **Minor:** new principle, criterion, or compatible normative requirement.
- **Patch:** clarification or correction that does not change intended obligations.

The current public release is **v1.4**. Material changes are documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
